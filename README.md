# plant_disease_surveillance_optimisation
The code is developed for the simulation of plant pathogen spread and the optimisation of the surveillance site location.

CONSTANT.py contains the parameter values used for the baseline model.

simulation.py and optimisation.py contains the main functions for simulating pathogen spread and optimising surveillance sites.

Code in folders "anaxx_" are for calling the main functions from simulation.py and optimisation.py to produce simulation realisations or optimisation results. Parameter values for sensitivity analysis can be changed in these code.
