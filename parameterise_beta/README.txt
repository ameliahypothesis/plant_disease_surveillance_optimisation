methods to parameterising beta:
1. using data of increasing prevalence in Nord-Kivu and Haut-Katanga over 2 years, together with alpha=3.5, init_prop=SIGMA0=0.05%, logistic growth rate of 0.25.
1. using data of increasing prevalence in Nord-Kivu and Haut-Katanga over 2 years, together with alpha=3.5, init_prop=SIGMA0=0.05%, logistic growth rate of 0.1693 -- ln(beta)=7.45. not working well
1. using data of increasing prevalence in Nord-Kivu and Haut-Katanga over 2 years, together with alpha=3.5, init_prop=SIGMA0=1%, logistic growth rate of 0.1693.
